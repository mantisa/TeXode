{"name":"Texode","tagline":"Markdown to LaTeX transpiler, for books and code blocks.","body":"### TeXode\r\nTeXode renders Markdown as LaTeX. Full documents and books can be rendered, or merely the code blocks, allowing you to forgo syntax highlighting in favor of MathJax-powered LaTeX blocks. Once LaTeX is produced, you will need to render the file with a LaTeX installation. This can then be converted to bear pdfs, amongst other formats. Alternatively, if you built only the code blocks, you can simply embed MathJax in a page rendering your Markdown as HTML.\r\n\r\nInstallation is as easy as copying and pasting the following command into your terminal:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/mattneary/TeXode.git; \\\r\n  echo \"\"; cd TeXode/lib; \\\r\n  ./install.sh `git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1`; cd ../..; \\\r\n  rm -rf TeXode/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will clone the repo into your current directory, then run the install script, and remove any intermediary files created in the process.\r\n\r\nFuture updates can be performed from within TeXode by the --update flag, and your version number checked by the -v flag.\r\n\r\n## Why LaTeX?\r\n1. LaTeX automatically assigns section counts.\r\n2. LaTeX has a very traditional appearance.\r\n3. LaTeX automatically paginates and numbers pages, making your documents more appropriate for print.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe command line interface of TeXode is designed to be as simple as possible, using sensible default behaviors. The two primary commands allow for files to be built to a directory, either rendering code for MathJax driven LaTeX or converting the full document to LaTeX. These commands work great within a *Makefile*.\r\n\r\n### Building Full Documents\r\nTo build full documents to LaTeX, pass the -b [book|document] *.md build/folder.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ texode -b book intro.md definitions.md build/folder\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building Only Code\r\nTo build just the code of documents to LaTeX, pass the -c *.md build/folder.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ texode -c intro.md definitions.md build/folder\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nTeXode is a project by [Matt Neary](http://github.com/mattneary) designed for his upcoming book, *Tarpits & Abstraction*.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
